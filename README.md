*🎲 A random word generator designed to destabilize standard LLM pattern and probability-based thinking.*

---

## 💭 The core issue

All LLMs run on **patterns** and **probabilities** — they predict what *should* come next, but never break from their training data.  
Even when asked to “be random,” they can’t truly leave that internal loop — they’re still inside the **fishbowl**. 🐠  

---

## 🧠 Overview  

The **Rabbit Response Team** breaks that loop.  
It fetches **truly random words** from outside the model (via real APIs) and **injects** them directly into the AI’s prompt.  
Each injected word must be used naturally in the model’s response — forcing the AI to adapt, improvise, and escape pattern lock.

### ✨ Features  

- 🎯 **Truly Random Words** — Pulled live from online dictionary APIs.  
- 🧩 **Fallback Generator** — Generates pronounceable nonsense words if APIs fail.  
- 🚫 **No Preselected Lists** — No static wordbanks; every run is unique.  
- 🪶 **Prompt Injection** — Words are added to the end of each AI prompt.  
- 🗣️ **Narrative Requirement** — AI must use each injected word in context.  
- ⚙️ **Adjustable Count** — Choose 1–10 words to inject per prompt.
- 🌀 **And More** — It's not a very big extension. What are you waiting for!

## 🧭 How to Use  

### 1️⃣ Enable the Extension  
- Go to **Extensions → Extension Settings**  
- Find **🐇 Rabbit Response Team**  
- Check **Enable Rabbit Response Team**  

### 2️⃣ Configure Randomization  
- **Word Count:** 1–10 (default: 3)  
- **Use Random Word API:** Fetches real words (requires internet)  
- **API Endpoint:** Customize your preferred API  
- **Fallback Option:** Auto-generate pronounceable words if API fails  

### 3️⃣ Test It  
Click **🎲 Test Random Words** to preview what the extension will inject.  
Each test gives a *completely different* set of words.  

### 4️⃣ Chat Normally  
The injected words will appear invisibly in your prompt’s backend,  
and the AI will weave them naturally into its response.

## 🧪 Try it out

It’s a small experiment, but one I really believe will work! I'd been thinking about it for quite some time. Let me know if you like it!
