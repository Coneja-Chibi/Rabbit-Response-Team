## 🎲 A random word generator designed to destabilize standard LLM pattern and probability-based thinking.

💭 The core idea

All LLMs operate on patterns and probabilities.
They’re great at predicting what “fits next,” but they can’t ever be truly random.
Even if you ask them to be random, it’s still happening inside their own boundaries — their fishbowl, so to speak. 🐠

⚙️ How it works

This little extension generates completely random words from outside the LLM, then injects them into the prompt with an instruction:

“These words must be used.”

Because the injection happens from outside the system, it forces the model to adapt — breaking its usual rhythm and nudging it out of pattern-lock.

🎯 The goal

To see if introducing true external randomness can make the model’s responses less predictable —
whether that means more creative prose, unexpected ideas, or simply new phrasing paths the AI wouldn’t normally take.

🧪 Try it out

It’s a small experiment: give it words, see what happens, and watch the model stumble into something interesting.
