A random word generator to try and destabilize standard LLM pattern/probability prone thinking!

My idea in its most basic parts is: All LLM's are is patterns and probability right? They are incapable of being truly random, and even if you ask them to be truly random they can't, because it's still within their 'fishbowl' so to speak. The goal of this little extension is to generate random words and then inject them into the prompt, telling the AI these words ***must*** be used. Because something inside the fishbowl can't edit it, but if something from the outside injects in, it should steer the LLM off it's usual routine/patterns right? That was just my idea anyways. Have fun playing with this! Let me know if it works to shake up prose!
(In depth read me not needed but it'll be coming soon anyways.)
